    <h1>Why land matters</h1>
    <h2>An introduction to the importance of 
        land and why we should protect our land ecosystem</h2>

    <h1>The land sustains every aspect of our lives</h1>
    <p>land sustains every aspect of our lives, providing fundamental life-support 
    systems and the foundation of our economy and society.</p>
    <p>It is the place we stand. And also the place we act. It is where we make decisions that affect not just the land, but also water, oceans, air, and atmosphere, and the life they support.</p>
      <p>This puts land at the centre of most environmental conversations in New Zealand.</p>

    <p>1.Food</p>
    <p>2.water</p>
    <p>3.raw materials</p>
    <p>4.dwellings</p>
    <p>5.shelter.</p>
    Land ecosystems are central to the maintenance of fundamental life-support systems for the planet: the air we breathe, temperatures we can endure, water we can drink, soils 
    sthat support the plants we use, and the creatures we co-exist with.

    <h1>Land and economic activity</h1>
    Land is also the foundation of New Zealand economic activity. Even in this digital era, Aotearoa New Zealand remains 
    an economy grounded in land-based production.
