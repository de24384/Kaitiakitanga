    <h1>Irrigated land in New Zealand</h1>
    <h2>This data provides a snapshot of irrigated land across mainland New Zealand in 2017. 
        The information can be useful for managing water takes and water quality in catchments.</h2>
<hr>
   <h1>Methodology</h1>
     <h4>The dataset combines a number of different data sources, including:</h4>
      <p>1.farm boundaries (using ownership data from Land Information New Zealand)</p>
       <p>2.aerial imagery (high resolution aerial and/or satellite photos)</p>
        <p>3.resource consent data (where available)</p>
         <p>4.analysis of satellite data (using normalised different vegetation index (NDVI) imagery)</p>
          <p>5.agricultural production statistics (sourced from Statistics New Zealand).</p>
     <p>Uncertainty estimates for each region take into account a range of data limitations, for example missing data from the sources listed above.</p>
     <p>A more detailed summary of the methodology is found within the report.Limitations</p>
<hr>
   <h1>Limitations</h1>
     <p>This is a national overview, largely created through desk-top analysis.  
        This means that the data should not be used at farm or irrigation-scheme scale in most regions without on-the-ground verification.  
        We will increase the precision of estimates for future updates.</p>
